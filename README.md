# Nabla

**Nabla** is a C++14 implementation of deep learning. It is suitable for deep learning on limited computational resource, embedded systems and IoT devices. This is the contnuation of the tiny-dnn project by marrying it with a powerful automatic differentiatior build as a clang plugin called [Clad](https://github.com/suhubdy/clad)
